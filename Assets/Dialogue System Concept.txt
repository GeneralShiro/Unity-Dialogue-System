Dialogue System - Concept:
=======================
- Dialogue is separated into "LINES" of dialogue.
- Each line has a "SPEAKER", who can optionally be identified with UI.
- Lines appearing one character at a time, with customizable speed. They can also be instantly finished with simple user input.
- When lines end, wait for user input to continue. Show UI to indicate user input is required.
- Lines should be capable of offering "BRANCHES" which change what line comes next.
- SPEAKERs have collection of available dialogue assets IDs
- Dialogue progression, identified by FLAGs, should be tracked and serializeable as saveable player data

	
DIALOGUE ASSET:
- has ID
- has collection of DIALOGUE LINE objects
- should not be altered at all; read-only

DIALOGUE MANAGER:
- Persistent monobehavior object
- Loads dialogue asset data needed
- Handles dialogue progression

DIALOGUE PROGRESS DATA:
- Saved data on user's progression through dialogue, to prevent unrepeatable dialogue lines from being respoken.


ADDITIONAL FEATURES:
=====================
- Event system (cues for animation, camera, etc.)
- Events should be available for:
	- On Dialogue Start
	- On Line Start
	- On Line End
	- On Branch Select
